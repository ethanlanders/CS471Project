# CS471 Course Project

This repository contains solutions to two programming problems completed for the CS471 course (Operating Systems) at Old Dominion University in Fall 2023. The problems cover important concepts like CPU scheduling and multithreading synchronization.

## Project Structure:

* **CPUSCHED**: Implements CPU scheduling algorithms (FIFO, SJF, and Priority Scheduling).
  * See `CPUSCHED/README.md` for detailed instructions and explanations.
* **PRODUCER-CONSUMER**: Implements the Producer-Consumer problem using threads in C++.
  * See `PRODUCER-CONSUMER/README.md` for detailed instructions and explanations.

For each problem, you will find relevant input files, instructions for compilation and execution, and output analysis.
